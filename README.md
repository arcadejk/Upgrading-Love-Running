# Upgrading-Love-Running

## Project Description
**"Love Running"** is a local running community website that allows users to drop in for a run or a social meetup at specific times and locations. The purpose of the website is to promote running by providing a platform for people to get together and encourage each other.

**Context**: I have been hired to implement an upgrade to the website based on user feedback requesting more functionality. In the following challenges, you will need to handle these requests using Agile practices.

The solution to these challenges should **increase the level of functionality** of the site and include features that **enhance interactions and widen the community.**

                    Project Scope:
                    To increase levels of user interaction, I am planning to include a poll on the home page; promptly, 
                    this new poll will appear on the home page to gather input or feedback from users such as the best time for running, best track… etc. 
                    Voters should be able to select an option, choose if they want to vote anonymously, and also add a comment.
                    The administrator of the site should be able to add votes and keep a record of all previous polls including voting details.

### Feature: Submit a Poll Response
#### User Story 1:
In order to provide my opinion with regards to a certain running topic or event as a user, I can select and submit from the poll.

#### User Story 2:
In order to provide anonymous feedback as a user, I can choose to hide my identity in the poll response.

#### User Story 3:
In order to provide additional thoughts beyond the response options as as user, I can add a comment before I submit my poll response.

These 3 related user stories, will build the complete feature of “Submitting a Poll Response”. 

### Feature: Publish a Poll
#### User Story 1:
In order to collect users feedback, as an administrator, I can publish a poll.

#### User Story 2:
In order to automatically hide the poll as an adminstrator, I can pick expiry date while publishing the poll.
